![mother](/assets/motherDB.png?raw=true "Mother DB")

The Multispecies Ovary Tissue Histology Electronic Repository (MOTHER) will provide a public repository of digitized microscopic images of ovary tissues along with the information that ensures image integrity and quality. 

This tool is based on a modified version of ezEML, a form based online application designed to streamline the creation of metadata in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) which defines a comprehensive vocabulary and a readable XML markup syntax for documenting research data.
