            from a data package, you are limited to importing from packages in your own ezEML account. Templates are
            visible to all users, however, so importing from templates lets multiple users use a shared template as a
            source for importing metadata. Previously, templates could only be used to create new data packages, and
            only the entire template could be used in that way. Now, you can import selected metadata from a template
            into an existing data package.

            Submit to EDI creates an archive file containing a data package's EML metadata and all uploaded
            data tables and other entities and sends an email to the data curators at EDI requesting submission of the
            data package to the EDI data repository. EDI's data curators will check the package and make any needed corrections
            before adding the package to the EDI data repository.

            A data package's EML metadata and all uploaded data tables and other entities can be exported in a single
            archive file, which is then available for download, either directly or via a URL that is provided. Such
            archive files can also be imported. See the Import/Export menu.

            This zip file can then be submitted to a data repository such as EDI's.

                The purpose of Re-upload is to let you update a data table's contents (e.g., because you've added some new rows or edited some cell values) without having to enter the properties of the data table and its columns all over again. It assumes the
 structure of the data table is largely unchanged. ezEML updates the corresponding metadata automatically.

A project may be associated with related projects. The EML standard treats one project as the main or primary project, which can have one or more related projects as "children".
This lets you associate different funding awards with different Principal Investigators, for example.
