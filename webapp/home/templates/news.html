            features that ezEML does not supoort, a detailed list of such cases is provided. In addition, a new method
            of editing complex text elements (abstracts, method step descriptions, etc.) is implemented for imported

            useful across the organization. Templates live outside of any individual user's ezEML account, so
            they are accessible to everyone. They can be tailored to fit the needs of particular LTER sites, for
            example. The <b>New from Template...</b> command appears in the <b>EML Documents</b> menu.
