            Submit to EDI creates an archive file containing a data package's EML metadata and all uploaded
            data tables and other entities and sends an email to the data curators at EDI requesting submission of the
            data package to the EDI data repository. EDI's data curators will check the package and make any needed corrections
            before adding the package to the EDI data repository.

            A data package's EML metadata and all uploaded data tables and other entities can be exported in a single
            archive file, which is then available for download, either directly or via a URL that is provided. Such
            archive files can also be imported. See the Import/Export menu.

            data table into the data table you're currently editing.

            but no errors (yellow), or has errors (red).

                Export Data Package creates a zip file containing the data package's metadata and data files and downloads it to the browser.
            This zip file can then be submitted to a data repository such as EDI's.

            The EML standard uses the term "Attributes" to refer to a data table's columns, but in the context of ezEML, "Columns" seems preferable.

            <b>Add support for Data Table Re-upload</b><br>
                The purpose of Re-upload is to let you update a data table's contents (e.g., because you've added some new rows or edited some cell values) without having to enter the properties of the data table and its columns all over again. It assumes the
 structure of the data table is largely unchanged. ezEML updates the corresponding metadata automatically.

            <b>Add support for Related Projects</b><br>
A project may be associated with related projects. The EML standard treats one project as the main or primary project, which can have one or more related projects as "children".
This lets you associate different funding awards with different Principal Investigators, for example.
