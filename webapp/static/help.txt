abstract
Abstract
The <b>Abstract</b> should be rich with descriptive text. Multiple paragraphs may be included.
In particular, descriptions should include information that does not fit into structured metadata.
The abstract will not be stored within the MOTHER database. However, MOTHER will share the XML metadata along with the image. 




An abstract is not required, but it is recommended if you have descriptive text to share about your image.
--------------------
add_load_data_tables
Add/Load Data Tables
You can create a data table's metadata "from scratch" via <b>Add Data Table from Scratch</b>, or you can load an existing data table CSV file via <b>Load Data Table from CSV File</b>.




In the latter case, many of the data table's characteristics will be automatically extracted or inferred from the file, but some others will still need to be entered or modified manually. <b>Note: If the file is modified after it is loaded, it will need to be re-uploaded, since some of the inferred metadata (e.g., checksum, file size) is version-specific.</b>




CSV files are assumed to contain a single header row.
--------------------
add_load_other_entities
Add/Load Other Entities
You can create an other entity's metadata "from scratch" via <b>Add Other Entity from Scratch</b>, or you can load an existing other entity file via <b>Load Other Entity from File</b>.




In the latter case, a number of the other entity's characteristics will be automatically extracted or inferred from the file, but some others will still need to be entered or modified manually. <b>Note: If the file is modified after it is loaded, it will need to be re-uploaded, since some of the inferred metadata (e.g., checksum, file size) is version-specific.</b>
--------------------
associatedParty
Associated Party
An associated party is someone who was involved with the image or data collection in some way (field technicians, students, assistants, etc.).




The EML specification requires that at least one of the following fields is required: Last Name, Organization, or Position Name. Note that including additional fields is useful. Note that the field <b>Role</b> is required to document the person’s role, e.g. <i>Scanned slide</i>.
--------------------
associated_parties
Associated Parties
Associated parties are other people who were involved with the image or data collection in some way (field technicians, students, assistants, etc.).




Associated parties are not required.
--------------------
attribute_definition
Column Definition
A precise definition of the column. It explains the contents of the column fully so that a data user can interpret the column accurately.




Example: "spden" is the number of individuals of all macro invertebrate species found in the plot.
--------------------
attribute_label
Column Label




A descriptive label that can be used to display the name of a column. This is often a longer name than the column name and may consist of multiple words. It is not constrained by system limitations on length or special characters in the way the column name is constrained.




For example, a column with a name of 'spcode' might have a column label of 'Species Code'.
--------------------
attribute_name
Column Name
Column name is the official name of the column. This is usually a short, sometimes cryptic name that is used to refer to the column. Many systems have restrictions on the length of column names and on the use of special characters such as spaces in the name, so the column name may not be ideal for display purposes (use Label for display).




The column name is usually the name of the variable in the header of a data file.
--------------------
attribute_datetime_format
Format String
A format string that describes the format for a DateTime value from the Gregorian calendar.




DateTime values should be expressed in a format that conforms to the ISO 8601 standard. To describe the format, construct a string representation of the format using the following symbols:
<ul>
<li>                  Y   year
<li>                  M   month
<li>                  W   month abbreviation (e.g., JAN)
<li>                  D   day
<li>                  h   hour
<li>                  m   minute
<li>                  s   second
<li>                  T   time designator (demarcates date and time parts of date-time)
<li>                  Z   UTC designator, indicating value is in UTC time
<li>                  .   indicates a decimal fraction of a unit
<li>                  +/- indicates a positive or negative number, or a positive or negative time zone adjustment relative to UTC
<li>                  -   indicates a separator between date components
<li>                  A/P am or pm designator
</ul>
                  Any other character in the format string is interpreted as a
                  separator character.  Here are some examples of the format
                  strings that can be constructed.
<pre>
                     Format string              Example value<br>
                     -------------------        ------------------<br>
  ISO Date           YYYY-MM-DD                 2002-10-14<br>
  ISO Datetime   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss        2002-10-14T09:13:45<br>
  ISO Datetime   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hh 2002-10-14T09:13:45-07<br>
  ISO Time           hh:mm:ss                   17:13:45<br>
  ISO Time           hh:mm:ss.sss               09:13:45.432<br>
  ISO Time           hh:mm.mm                   09:13.42
</pre>
--------------------
attribute_datetime_precision
DateTime Precision
A quantitative indication of the precision of a date or time value.




The precision should be interpreted in the smallest units represented by the dateTime format. For example, if a dateTime value has a format of "hh:mm:ss.sss", then "seconds" are the smallest unit and the precision should be expressed in seconds. Thus, a precision value of "0.01" would mean that measurements were precise to the nearest hundredth of a second, even though the format string might indicate that values were written down with 3 decimal places.
--------------------
attribute_number_type
Number Type
The possible values for <b>Number Type</b> are as follows:<br>
<b>Real</b> - Continuous quantities that can be represented by decimal values, e.g. 2.0, 3.14, -2.718, 42, 0<br>
<b>Integer</b> - Positive or negative values that can be written without a fractional component, e.g., 3, -2, 127, 0<br>
<b>Natural</b> - The "counting numbers": 1, 2, 3, etc.<br>
<b>Whole</b> - The natural numbers plus the number zero, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
--------------------
attribute_numerical_precision
Precision
The precision of the measurement.




Precision indicates how close together or how repeatable measurements are. A precise measuring instrument will give very nearly the same result each time it is used. This means that someone interpreting the data should expect that if a measurement were repeated, most measured values would fall within the interval specified by the precision. The value of precision should be expressed in the same unit as the measurement. For example, for a column with unit "meter", a precision of "0.1" would be interpreted to mean that most repeat measurements would fall within an interval of 1/10th of a meter.
--------------------
attribute_storage_type
Storage Type
<b>Storage Type</b> provides a "hint" for processing systems as to how the column's data might be represented in a system or language. Values for this field are by default drawn from the XML Schema data types standard values, such as: integer, double, string, etc.




<b>Storage Type System</b> specifies the system used to define the storage types. It should be an identifier of a well known and published typing system. The default and recommended system is the XML Schema data type system. For details go to http://www.w3.org. If another system is used (such as Java or C++ types), <b>Storage Type System</b> should be changed accordingly.
--------------------
award
Funding Award
Information on a funding award associated with the project.




Required fields are provided for the name of the funding agency, the title of the award and award number.




Optional fields are provided as well for the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award, the award number assigned, and the URL to the award page describing the award.
--------------------
award_number
Award Number
The unique identifier used by the funder to uniquely identify an award.




These are typically alphanumeric values that are unique within the system used by a given funder. The number should be listed using the canonical form that each funder uses to express its award numbers and should not be prefixed or postfixed with extra text such as the acronym of the funder or the name of the funder, which is available instead in the Funder Name field.
--------------------
award_title
Award Title
The title of the award or grant. This field is required.




Example:  Scientia Arctica: A Knowledge Archive for Discovery and Reproducible Science in the Arctic
--------------------
award_url
Award URL
The URL associated with the award.




Typically, the Award URL is used to find and locate the award on the funding agency’s site, and it generally addresses the internet location to find out more information about the award.




It should point to a funder site for the award, rather than a project site.
--------------------
awards
Funding Awards
The funding awards for the project.




Each funding award is described by the name of the funding agency, the title of the award, and award number. 




Optional fields are provided as well for the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award and the funding agency’s URL to the award page describing the award.
--------------------
bounding_altitudes
Bounding Altitudes
<b>Bounding Altitudes</b> lets you specify altitudinal (elevation) measurements for the bounding box being described. The minimum and maximum altitudes should be in reference to a known datum (e.g., Mean Sea Level), which should be specified as part of the Geographic Description.




If any of the fields (Altitude Minimum, Altitude Maximum, Altitude Units) are filled in, they all must be.
--------------------
bounding_coordinates
Bounding Coordinates
<b>Bounding Coordinates</b> are the four margins (N, S, E, W) of a bounding box, or when considered in lat-lon pairs, the corners of the box. These elements are meant to convey general information and are not for accurate mapping.




The limits of coverage of a data set should be expressed as <b>decimal latitudes and longitudes</b>. By convention, latitudes and longitudes are referenced to the Equator and to the Prime Meridian, respectively. By definition, the 0 and 180 meridians themselves do not belong in either hemisphere, but local conventions may place them in either.




All coordinates are typed as decimals. Since all four elements are required, a bounding area that is a single point should use the same values for North Bounding Coordinate and South Bounding Coordinate, and likewise for West Bounding Coordinate and East Bounding Coordinate.




In the case of a data set that comprises all longitudes (e.g., a horizontal band between 2 parallels that fully encompasses the earth), use a West Bounding Coordinate of -180.0 and an eastBoundingCoordinate of 180.0 (or +180.0).
--------------------
clone_attributes_general
Clone Column Properties from Another Data Table
Suppose you’ve uploaded one data table and filled out its columns’ properties, and then you upload a second data table, and some or all of the second table’s columns have the same properties (except possibly for column name) as particular columns in the first table. It would be inconvenient to have to enter the second table’s columns’ properties all over again. Instead, you can use <b>Clone Column Properties from Another Data Table</b> to “clone” the properties of selected columns in the first table into specified columns in the second table.




In the scenario above, we refer to the first data table as the <b>source</b> table and the second data table as the <b>target</b> table. The source table is not required to be in the current data package. It could be in another data package you prepared with ezEML at an earlier time.
--------------------
clone_attributes_1
Clone Column Properties from Another Data Table
Suppose you’ve uploaded one data table and filled out its columns’ properties, and then you upload a second data table, and some or all of the second table’s columns have the same properties (except possibly for column name) as particular columns in the first table. It would be inconvenient to have to enter the second table’s columns’ properties all over again. Instead, you can use <b>Clone Column Properties from Another Data Table</b> to “clone” the properties of selected columns in the first table into specified columns in the second table.




In the scenario above, we refer to the first data table as the <b>source</b> table and the second data table as the <b>target</b> table. The source table is not required to be in the current data package. It could be in another data package you prepared with ezEML at an earlier time.




Begin by selecting the data package that contains the source data table. This may be the current data package or some other one. Then click <b>Open for Cloning</b>.
--------------------
clone_attributes_2
Clone Column Properties from Another Data Table
Having selected the data package that contains the source data table, the next step is to select the source data table from the list of data tables in the package. Then click <b>Select Data Table</b>.
--------------------
clone_attributes_3
Clone Column Properties
Having selected the source data table, the next step is to select the particular columns in the source data table whose properties you wish to clone.




Select one or more columns, then click <b>Select Columns</b>.




<b>Note:</b> If you want to clone a number of columns, you can do them all in the same pass, or you can do one or a few columns at a time if that seems more manageable. I.e., you can clone some columns, take a look at the result, then clone some more columns, etc., by going through the <b>Clone Column Properties from Another Data Table</b> process repeatedly.
--------------------
clone_attributes_4
Clone Column Properties
Having selected the particular columns whose properties you wish to clone, the next step is to match them up with the columns in the target data table that will receive the cloned properties.




For each Source Column, select a Target Column in the target data table, then click <b>Clone Column Properties</b>. Note that the source and target columns do not have to have the same names in the two tables or appear in the same order.




The properties of the source columns will be copied into the target columns, except that the <b>Name</b> of each target column will not be changed.




Categorical columns get special handling: codes in the target column are preserved, but if a code exists in the source column, the source column's definition for the code is used.
--------------------
contact
Contact
At least one <b>Contact</b> is required.




Full contact information should be included for the position of data manager or other designated contact and should be kept current and independent of personnel changes. If multiple contacts are listed (e.g. both a data and site manager) all should be kept current. Technicians who performed the work belong under <b>Associated Party</b> rather than <b>Contact</b>.
--------------------
contacts
Contacts
At least one <b>Contact</b> is required.




Full contact information should be included for the designated contact for the image. The information should be kept current and independent of personnel changes. Note that there are other types of people that can be added as you progress through the People content, e.g. Metadata Provider or Associated Party.
--------------------
contents
Contents
You can use ezEML+MOTHER as a "wizard" (i.e., by proceeding through the sections in sequence, filling out the metadata as you go), or you can click on any of the links under <b>Contents</b> to jump directly to that section of the metadata.
--------------------
creator
Creator
The creator is considered to be the owner of the image, i.e. the person(s) responsible for  its creation. At least one creator is required. 


The EML specification requires that at least one of the following fields is required: Last Name, Organization, or Position Name. Note that including additional fields to identify the creator is useful, e.g. ORCID. 
--------------------
creators
Creators
The creator is considered to be the owner of the image, i.e. the person(s) responsible for  its creation. At least one creator is required. 
--------------------
data_package_id
Data Package ID
EML requires a data package to have a <b>Data Package ID</b>, but if your data package is going to be submitted to EDI's data repository by using <b>Submit to EDI</b>, you can leave the Data Package ID blank. Our data curators will supply an ID when they receive your data package.




In the event that you've already obtained a Data Package ID (e.g., from an LTER site information manager), however, go ahead and enter it here.




For data repositories other than EDI’s, contact the data repository for an appropriate Data Package ID value.
--------------------
data_table
Data Table
A data table is one tabular entity in the data package, identified by its name. The data table descriptor can contain information about the data table's orientation, number of records, case sensitivity, and temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage.
--------------------
data_tables
Data Tables
A data table is one tabular entity in the data package, identified by its name. The data table descriptor can contain information about the data table's orientation, number of records, case sensitivity, and temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage.
--------------------
data_table_reupload
Re-upload Data Table
The purpose of <b>Re-upload Data Table</b> is to let you update a data table's contents (e.g., because you've added some new rows or edited some cell values) without having to enter the properties of the data table and its columns all over again.




Moreover, if you later use <b>Export Data Package</b> to create a zip file containing the EML metadata and all of the data tables and other entities associated with the data package, <b>it is essential that the final, corrected versions of all files have been uploaded to ezEML</b>, because it is the versions that have been uploaded to ezEML that will be included in the exported data package, ready to be submitted to a data repository.




<b>Re-upload Data Table</b> requires the number of columns in the table to be the same as in the original table, but it allows column names and types to change.
--------------------
data_table_reupload_full
Re-upload Data Table
The purpose of <b>Re-upload Data Table</b> is to let you update a data table's contents (e.g., because you've added some new rows or edited some cell values) without having to enter the properties of the data table and its columns all over again.




Moreover, if you later use <b>Export Data Package</b> to create a zip file containing the EML metadata and all of the data tables and other entities associated with the data package, <b>it is essential that the final, corrected versions of all files have been uploaded to ezEML</b>, because it is the versions that have been uploaded to ezEML that will be included in the exported data package, ready to be submitted to a data repository.




<b>Re-upload Data Table</b> requires the number of columns in the table to be the same as in the original table, but it allows column names and types to change.




Choose the CSV file containing the updated data table, and set the Field Delimiter and Quote Character, as needed. Then click <b>Re-upload</b> to perform the update. Table properties such as Size, Number of Records, and MD5 Checksum will be recalculated automatically. Properties of the data table's columns will be preserved to the extent possible.




The CSV file's name is not required to be the same as the name of the CSV file uploaded previously.
--------------------
data_table_name

The number of header lines preceding the data. I.e., the number of header lines that should be skipped before starting to parse the data.
--------------------
data_table_quote_character
Quote Character
Character used to quote values for delimiter escaping.




If your data table is a CSV file with fields separated by commas, for example, then a text field that contains one or more commas will appear to be multiple fields. To deal with such cases where the field delimiter is used within a text field, enclose the text field in quotes. <b>Quote Character</b> defines which "flavor" of quotes you are using, double quotes (") or single quotes (').
--------------------
data_table_record_delimiter
Record Delimiter
Character(s) used to delimit records (e.g., rows).




The record delimiter is usually a linefeed (\n) on UNIX, a carriage return (\r) on MacOS, or both (\r\n) on Windows/DOS.
--------------------
data_table_case_sensitive
Case Sensitive
Specifies text case sensitivity of the data in the data table. The valid values are yes or no.




If it is set to yes, then values that differ only in case (e.g.,LOW, low) represent distinct values. If set to no, then values that differ only in case represent the same value.
--------------------
data_table_number_of_records
Number of Records
The integer count of the number of records in the data table.




It should only include records that represent observations. I.e., it would not include any details of physical formatting such as the number of header lines.
--------------------
data_table_online_url
Online Distribution URL
If the data table is available online, its URL address.
--------------------
donor
Donor
Fill in the Donor information below. Fields with an  " <b>*</b> " next to the field name are required. Some fields are enabled/disabled based on certain selections, e.g. <b>Corpus Luteum Type</b> is only enabled if the <b>Specimen Location</b> is <i>corpus luteum</i>.




NOTE: <br/>
<b>Donor ID</b>: This must be a unique designation of the donor animal for the ovary image across ALL donors in the MOTHER database. Thus, this is not a simple number but should be an encoding of a combination of information, such as lab-date-sequence or genus-species-animalID. For example, <i>BC_2020-09-14_106_F</i>.<br/>
<b>Specimen Sequence Number</b>: This is typically 1, unless there are multiple ovaries collected for the same donor. <br/>
<b>Cycle Type</b> and its corresponding <b>Stage of Cycle</b>: menstrual and estrous cycles are currently supported. If you have a donor animal with a different cycle type, please contact the MOTHER team. </br>
<b>Slide ID</b>: The slide ID must be unique for the donor and specimen sequence number. If you are sharing multiple sections of the same slide, then the ID must be a combination of the slide number and section number. <br/>
<b>Section Sequence Number</b>: This field is optionally and should only be used if you are submitting a collection of images allowing for a 3D reconstruction.<br/>
--------------------
export_package
Export ezEML Data Package
When you have entered all required metadata and uploaded all associated data files (data tables and other entities) to ezEML, you're ready to export the data package.




<b>Export ezEML Data Package</b> creates an archive (zip) file containing the EML metadata (in both XML format and ezEML's JSON format) and the data files. This archive file can be downloaded to your computer. You will also be provided with a URL address for downloading the archive, which you can share with collaborators, for example.




To submit the data package to the EDI data repository, you can go directly to <b><a href="edit/home.submit_package">Submit to EDI</a></b> which will take care of creating the archive and sending it to EDI for submission.
--------------------
funder_identifiers
Funder Identifier(s)
One or more canonical identifiers that reference the funder. If entering more than one identifier, separate them by commas.




These identifiers should be globally unique. The most common form of a funder identifier is a DOI identifier of an institution or program drawn from the CrossRef Open Funder Registry (https://github.com/Crossref/open-funder-registry), which assigns DOIs to each funding agency and to their programs and links these together in a navigable hierarchy.
--------------------
funder_name
Funder Name
The name of the funding institution, with fully expanded acronyms to show the full, official name of the funding agency. This field is required.




In general, this should match the official name of the funder as listed in an Authority such as the Open Funder Registry.
--------------------
geographic_coverages
Geographic Coverage
<b>Geographic Coverage</b> describes locations of sites or areas related to the data, and is intended for general placement of points on a map. A <b>Geographic Coverage</b> element need not be included but should be if the donor was collected at a known geographic location.


The <b>Add Geographic Coverage</b> button provides a form to enter the specification of a geographic description and bounding coordinates, which are required, along with optional altitude information. 
--------------------
geographic_coverages_csv_file
Add / Load Geographic Coverage
You can enter <b>Geographic Coverage</b> elements (bounding boxes) directly in ezEML+MOTHER by clicking <b>Add Geographic Coverage</b>, or you can click <b>Load Geographic Coverage from CSV File</b> to load geographic coverage elements from a comma-separated value (CSV) file that you have prepared in advance.




In the latter case, the CSV file is required to have the following format:
<ul>
<li>A header row consisting of:&nbsp;
"geographicDescription,northBoundingCoordinate,southBoundingCoordinate,eastBoundingCoordinate,westBoundingCoordinate,minimumAltitude,maximumAltitude,altitudeUnits"
<li>The geographicDescription column contains strings (text).
<li>The bounding coordinate columns contain latitude/longitude coordinates in decimal degrees format.
<li>For latitudes (north/south coordinates), use a minus sign for latitudes south of the equator.
<li>For longitudes (east/west coordinates), use a minus sign for longitudes west of the prime meridian.
<li>Altitude Minimum and Altitude Maximum need to be in decimal format (e.g., 0.0 rather than 0).
<li>Altitude Units must be one of the following: meter, nanometer, micrometer, micron, millimeter, centimeter, decimeter, dekameter, hectameter, kilometer, megameter, angstrom, inch, foot, Foot_US, yard, mile, nauticalMile, fathom, Foot_Gold_Coast, Yard_Indian, Link_Clarke, Yard_Sears.
<li>If you are not specifying Bounding Altitudes, leave the corresponding table cells blank.
</ul>




Example:<br>
geographicDescription,northBoundingCoordinate,southBoundingCoordinate,eastBoundingCoordinate,westBoundingCoordinate,minimumAltitude,maximumAltitude,altitudeUnits<br>
Lake Wingra,43.062543,43.058787,-89.415478,-89.432468,0.00,2.50,meter<br>

Select the geographic coverages to import.




If none are shown, none are available in the selected data package.
--------------------
import_package
Upload XML
<b>Upload XML</b> lets you upload an xml file that was downloaded from ezEML+MOTHER.




Once you have created the XML metadata for a donor animal for its first histology image that you want to share, you can upload the XML file for a new document associated with any other histology images for the donor. Note that all information except the Title, Image, and Slide ID will be uploaded for the new document.  Since the Title, Image, and Slide ID are unique per slide, this information must be entered for each slide.
--------------------
import_package_2
Import an ezEML Data Package
If the data package you are importing has the same name as one that already exists in your ezEML account, ezEML asks you whether you'd like to replace the existing package or import the package as a copy, instead. This is similar to what happens when you use "Save As" in a program like Microsoft Word, for example.




If you elect to <b>Replace</b> the package, the existing version will be overwritten by the new version.




Suppose, instead, that you elect to <b>Copy</b> the package. If the existing package is called my_data_package, then the new version will be saved as my_data_package_COPY (or my_data_package_COPY2,  my_data_package_COPY3, etc., as needed).
--------------------
import_related_projects
Import Related Projects
You may import one or more projects from another data package to be incorporated in the current data package as related projects.




The projects you import may be a main project or a related project in the other data package, but in the current data package they will be treated as related projects.
--------------------
import_related_projects_2
Import Related Projects
Select the projects you wish to import as related projects.




If none are listed, none are available in the selected data package.
--------------------
import_responsible_parties
Import Responsible Parties
You may import the details for one or more responsible parties (persons, organizations, or positions) who have been specified as Creators, Contacts, etc. in another data package. This saves you from having re-enter their details.




The parties you import do not have to be used for the same purpose in this data package as they were in the other data package. For example, a person who was a Contact in another data package can be imported into this data package as an Associated Party.




<b>Note that you may also "import" from the current data package, for example to re-use one or more Creators as Contacts or Project Personnel.</b>
--------------------
import_responsible_parties_2
Import Responsible Parties
Select the responsible parties (persons, organizations, positions) whose details you wish to import, and select how they will be used in the current data package, i.e., as Creators, Metadata Providers, Associated Parties, Contacts, or Project Personnel.




If none are listed, none are available in the selected data package.
--------------------
import_taxonomic_coverage
Import Taxonomic Coverage
You may import selected taxonomic coverage details from another data package.




Note that you may also "import" from the current data package, to "copy and paste" a taxonomy you can then edit.




Currently, only taxonomic coverages at the data package level (as opposed to the individual data table level) are available to import.
--------------------
import_taxonomic_coverage_2
Import Taxonomic Coverage
Select the taxonomic coverages to import.




If none are shown, none are available in the selected data package.
--------------------
intellectual_rights
Intellectual Rights
Intellectual rights are controlled at the source, however it is recommended that data be released with as few restrictions as possible.




The specification of intellectual rights is required. 
--------------------
keywords
Keywords
It is recommended that meaningful sets of keywords be provided. MOTHER will provide a keyword search capability. In particular, each keyword added should provide information beyond the structured metadata. Is the histology image of an endangered species? Is this image part of a toxicology experiment? 




Keywords are optional but recommended to provide information that extends beyond the structured metadata. 




--------------------
maintenance
Maintenance
A description of the maintenance of this data resource.




This includes information about the frequency of update and whether there is ongoing data collection.
--------------------
maintenance_description
Maintenance Description
A text description of the maintenance of this data resource.




It may consist of multiple paragraphs.
--------------------
maintenance_freq
Maintenance Update Frequency
Frequency with which changes and additions are made to the dataset after the initial dataset is completed.
--------------------
metadataProvider
Metadata Provider
A metadata provider is a person(s) or organization(s) responsible for providing or producing the metadata content. For example, a person who is designated to use the ezEML+MOTHER tool to generate the valid metadata for the image should be listed as a metadata provider. 




A metadata provider is not required but if given, the EML specification requires that at least one of the following fields is required: Last Name, Organization, or Position Name. Note that including additional fields is useful in identifying the person. 
--------------------
metadata_provider
Metadata Provider
A metadata provider is a person(s) or organization(s) responsible for providing or producing the metadata content. For example, a person who is designated to use the ezEML+MOTHER tool to generate the valid metadata for the image should be listed as a metadata provider. 




A metadata provider is not required but if given, the EML specification requires that at least one of the following fields is required: Last Name, Organization, or Position Name. Note that including additional fields is useful in identifying the person. 
--------------------
measurement_scale
Variable Type
Columns (variables) can have the following types: Categorical, Numerical, Text, or DateTime.




<b>Categorical</b> variables contain alphanumeric codes used to categorize data. Examples of categorical variables are 1 for Male and 2 for Female, or M for Male and F for Female. Some categorical variable codes convey an order (e.g., Low, Medium, High), others do not.




<b>Numerical</b> variables contain ordinary numerical data, i.e., numerical values not used for categorization. Values may be integers (e.g., counts of specimens) or real numbers (e.g., temperature, pH). Units are required for all numerical variables.




<b>Text</b> variables contain text values not used for categorization. Examples include names or identification numbers of experimental subjects.




<b>DateTime</b> variables contain date and time values. Note that time <i>durations</i> should be treated as Numerical values.




To change the type of a variable (e.g., from Categorical to Text) click <b>Change Type</b> and select the new type.
--------------------
metadata_providers
Metadata Providers
The metadata provider is the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for providing or producing the metadata content.




Metadata providers are not required.
--------------------
methods
Method Steps
Method steps are descriptions of specific steps of the method employed when collecting data. They are intended to be descriptive, i.e., human-readable rather than machine-readable.




The method steps document a series of procedures followed. These may include text descriptions of the procedures for an experiment, relevant literature, software, instrumentation, source data and any quality control measures taken.
--------------------
method_step_description
Method Step Description
Description of the methods employed in collecting or generating the  resource or in quality control and assurance.




Describe the methodology for a project, experiment, or particular data table or the steps taken to control or assure the quality of the data. Likewise, a literature citation may be provided that describes the methodology that was employed. Or the information may be provided by either referencing a protocol resource or entering the structured protocol information.
--------------------
method_step_instrumentation
Method Step Instrumentation
Description of instruments used for measurement and recording data.




This may include any instruments used in the data collection or quality control and quality assurance. The description should provide vendor, model number, optional equipment, etc.
--------------------
method_step_data_sources
Method Step Data Sources
If you used other data sources in this method step, please document them here.




For each data source used, include, if possible:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- the data source title<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- a URL, DOI, or other globally unique identifier<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- a creator's name and email<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- a contact's name and email.

Navigating in ezEML+MOTHER
The <b>Save and Continue</b> button saves any changes you've made on the current page and moves you ahead to the next section of the metadata. You can step through the sections sequentially using <b>Save and Continue</b>, or you can click any of the links under <b>Contents</b> in the left margin to save changes and jump directly to a particular section of the metadata.




The <b>Reset Changes</b> button clears the changes you've made on the current page and leaves you on that page.




<i>You can think of using ezEML+MOTHER as filling out one big form that's organized as a number of separate pages. As you move from page to page, your changes are automatically retained (as you'd expect when filling out a form), except in the cases where a page has a </i><b>Cancel</b><i> button, which lets you exit that page without saving.</i>




The <b>ezEML+MOTHER</b> link at the top left of each page serves as a "Home" button, taking you back to the top of the Contents list.




It's usually best to refrain from using your browser's forward and back buttons. Using them may cause you to lose unsaved edits.




--------------------
new_eml_document
Document Name
Provide a document name for the metadata. This is the name by which the document will be known to ezEML+MOTHER. Think of it as you would a file name (without file extension). It can be any name that will be meaningful to you, for example if you come back to the tool at a later time.




This document name will not appear in the XML itself.
--------------------
other_entities
Other Entities
<b>Other Entities</b> are data entities other than data tables that will be included in the data package. They are identified by their names.




Examples might include scripts in Python or R, zip files containing ancillary data, photographs and other imagery, etc.
--------------------
other_entity
Image
An <b>Image</b> requires a name, its type and format. The current default image type is histology. The digitized ovary slide image should be selected using the <b>Choose File</b> button under the label <b>Upload Image</b>. Include any <b>Additional Information </b> about the image, if desired. See additional info ? for suggestions. The <b>Upload and Continue</b> button will upload the image, associating the image with the document, and automatically filling in the image name and data format fields.
--------------------
other_entity_info
Additional Info
Although additional info is not required, you may want to include any other metadata for the image that is not collected by MOTHER. For example, you can include the bibliographic information if the image is related to a publication. Do you have additional measurements that you collected for your donor? If so, using JSON-like key: value pairs separated by semi-colons is preferred over free text, allowing for parsing of the data from the XML metadata. 


Example: <i>Body Weight(g): 130.56; Gonad Weight(g): 3.45; Shell Length(cm): 14.7; Shell Width(cm): 9.8; Gonad Length(cm): 4.7</i>
--------------------
other_entity_reupload
Re-upload Other Entity
The purpose of <b>Re-upload Other Entity</b> is to let you update an other entity file without having to enter the properties of the other entity all over again. In addition, it updates the file size and checksum, which are part of the metadata describing the other entity.




Moreover, if you later use <b>Export Data Package</b> to create a zip file containing the EML metadata and all of the data tables and other entities associated with the data package, <b>it is essential that the final, corrected versions of all files have been uploaded to ezEML</b>, because it is the versions that have been uploaded to ezEML that will be included in the exported data package, ready to be submitted to a data repository.
--------------------
personnel
Project Personnel
Contact and role information for a person/organization involved in the research project.


The EML specification requires that at least one of the following fields is required: Last Name, Organization, or Position Name. Note that including additional fields is useful. Note that the field <b>Role</b> is required to document the person’s role, e.g. <i>Senior Personnel</i>.
--------------------
project
Project
This documents the research context of an image or another project. It can include research goals, motivations, theory, hypotheses, etc., as well as a description of research efforts that form the basis for other work.




To document <i>methods</i> specific to the histology image, use <b>Methods</b>.




A project is required to have a Project Title.
--------------------
project_title
Project Title
A descriptive title for the research project.




Example: Multispecies Ovary Tissue Histology Electronic Repository (MOTHER)
--------------------
pubdate
Publication Date
The year or date of public release of data online.




Because this element may be used in constructing citations, the publication date also should  reflect the 'recentness' of a package. I.e., it should be updated along with significant revisions or data additions (e.g., corrected data or additions to an ongoing time series).




There is an argument for publication date referring to the original date of release, but this is probably only useful for static data packages, or if the only metadata changes are to enhance discovery.
--------------------
publisher
Publisher
The organization producing the EML metadata. Publisher is not required by EML.
--------------------
pubplace
Publication Place
The location where the resource was published, which may be different from where the resource was created.




Example: Madison, WI, USA
--------------------
pubdate
Publication Date
The date of publication.




Publication date is not required by EML. If you submit your data to the EDI data repository, the date of publication will be entered automatically by EDI.
--------------------
related_project
Related Project
A project may be associated with related projects. EML treats one project as the main or primary project, which can then have one or more related projects as "children".




Splitting projects up in this way lets you associate different funding awards with different Principal Investigators, for example.
--------------------
project_personnel
Project Personnel
This documents the people involved in a research project by providing their contact information and role in the project.
--------------------
project_title
Project Title
A descriptive title for the research project.




Example: Species diversity in Tennessee riparian habitats.
--------------------
save_as_document
Document Name
Provide a document name for the data package. This is the name by which the document will be known to ezEML. Think of it as you would a file name (without file extension). It can be any name that will be meaningful to you, for example if you come back to ezEML at a later time.




This document name will not appear in the EML itself. I.e., it is distinct from the Title and Data Package ID, both of which are saved in the EML.
--------------------
send_to_colleague
Submit Metadata
Before submission, please verify that there is no error in the XML by clicking on the <i>Check Metadata</i> content. A red dot indicates that an error exists in the XML. An orange dot indicates warnings, and a green dot indicates that there are no errors or warnings.




After reviewing the metadata checking to verify that your metadata is complete for your uploaded image, you can submit the image and metadata to the MOTHER project. The <b>Submit Metadata</b> uploads the image and xml file to the server. Once uploaded, ezEML+MOTHER will provide a <b>Download ZIP</b> button to download a zip file of the image and xml submitted. <i>Please download the zip file for your records.</i> Once you have submitted all of your histology images to share on MOTHER, please contact the MOTHER team for curation.
--------------------
send_to_colleague_2
Submit Metadata

--------------------
storage_type
Storage Type
This element describes the storage type for data in a RDBMS (or other data management system) field.




Values for this field are by default drawn from the XML Schema Datatypes standard values, such as: integer, double, string, etc. If the XML Schema Datatypes are not used, the type system from which the values are derived should be specified in the Storage Type System field.




Storage Type represents a 'hint' to processing systems as to how the column's contents might be represented in a system or language.




Examples:
  integer
  int
--------------------
storage_type_system
Storage Type System
The system used to define the storage types. This should be an identifier of a well known and published typing system.




The default and recommended system is the XML Schema data type system. For details go to http://www.w3.org. If another system is used (such as Java or C++ types), typeSystem should be changed to match the system.




Examples:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes
  java
  C
  Oracle 8i
--------------------
submit_package
Send to EDI
When you've entered all required metadata and uploaded all associated data files (data tables and other entities) to ezEML, you're ready to submit your data package to the data repository hosted by the <a href="https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/" target="_blank"><b>Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)</b></a>.




When you click <b>Send to EDI</b>, an ezEML Data Package archive file is generated, and an email is automatically sent to the data curators at EDI. This email contains a link to the archive file. EDI's data curators will download the archive file, check its contents, make corrections as needed, and submit the data package to EDI's repository.




Please provide your name and email so that EDI's data curators can contact you with any questions they have and to let you know when the submission has been completed. If you have questions (about particular entries in your metadata, for example), please use the <b>Notes</b> text area to describe them so EDI can assist you better.




<b>Please note:</b> When you click <b>Send to EDI</b>, your data package is sent to EDI's data curators for review. There will be some amount of delay before your package appears in EDI's Data Portal. EDI's data curators will email you when the package has been added to the repository.




To send your package to someone other than EDI, use <b>Send to Colleague</b>.
--------------------
taxonomic_coverages
Taxonomic Coverage
<b>Taxonomic Coverage</b> must be used to document taxonomic information for the donor of the histology slide.




The lowest available level, preferably the species binomial and common name should always be included, but higher-level taxa should also be included to support broader taxonomic searches. ezEML can fill in the higher-level taxa for you by accessing a taxonomic authority online.
--------------------
taxonomic_coverage_fill_hierarchy
Fill Hierarchy
<b>Fill Hierarchy</b> retrieves and lists the higher-level taxa associated with a given taxon.




Enter the Taxon Scientific Name for the most specific relevant taxon (e.g., species or genus), select a taxonomic authority to access, and click <b>Fill Hierarchy</b>. ezEML+MOTHER will send requests to the selected taxonomic authority to retrieve the higher-level taxa, as well as any associated common names, and the taxon ID for each taxon. The taxon IDs let ezEML+MOTHER construct links to the corresponding pages on the taxonomic authority website. These data will be entered in the EML document as well.




The Taxon Scientific Name you enter should be the scientific name for the taxon, not a common name. For a species, this is a binomial name.




If the specified taxon is found in the taxonomic authority database, the Taxon Rank will be set automatically. I.e., if you are going to use <b>Fill Hierarchy</b> for a known taxon, you don't need to worry about getting the taxon rank right. The Taxon Rank selection list is there to cover cases where the taxon you've entered is not found in the supported taxonomic authorities but you want to save it as entered. In such cases, you can still click <b>Save and Continue</b> and the taxon rank and taxon name will be saved in the EML exactly as you've entered them.
--------------------
temporal_coverages
Temporal Coverage
<b>Temporal Coverage</b> represents the period of time the data were collected, not the year the study was conducted if it uses retrospective or historical data.




Two formats are allowed, either a 4-digit year, or a date in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD.
--------------------
title
Title
The <b>Title</b> field provides a description of the image. It should be long enough to differentiate it from other images. ezEML requires a unique title.




It should be descriptive and should mention the data collected, geographic context, research site, and time frame (i.e., what, where, and when).




Example: <i>Zelinski Lab: Rhesus macaque 19006 Unspecified Ovary 001a</i>
--------------------
welcome
Welcome to ezEML+MOTHER




Welcome to ezEML+MOTHER! Here is some initial guidance on its use.




You can think of using ezEML+MOTHER as filling out one big form that's organized as a number of separate pages. As you move from page to page, your changes are automatically retained (as you'd expect when filling out a form), except in the cases where a page has a <b>Cancel</b> button, which lets you exit that page without saving.




<b>Save and Continue</b> buttons save any changes you've made on the current page and move you ahead to the next section of the metadata. You can step through the sections sequentially using <b>Save and Continue</b>, or you can click any of the links under <b>Contents</b> in the left margin to save changes and jump directly to a particular section of the metadata.




<b>Reset Changes</b> buttons clear the changes you've made on the current page and leave you on that page.




The <b>ezEML+MOTHER</b> link at the top left of each page serves as a "Home" button, taking you back to the top of the Contents list.




It's usually best to refrain from using your browser's forward and back buttons. Using them may cause you to lose unsaved edits.




Notice that there are lots of Help buttons in ezEML (see the circular question mark icons). You may find them helpful.




We won't show you this welcome dialog again, but you can always review how to navigate in ezEML+MOTHER either by clicking the help button next to <b>Reset Changes</b> on this <b>Title</b> page or by going to the <a style="color: steelblue;" href="/eml/user_guide">User Guide</a>.




We hope you find ezEML+MOTHER useful, and we welcome your feedback at <a style="color: steelblue;" href="mailto:motherdbproject@gmail.com">motherdbproject@gmail.com</a>.
