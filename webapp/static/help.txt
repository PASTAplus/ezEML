abstract
Abstract
The <b>Abstract</b> will be used for full-text searches, and it should be rich with descriptive text. Multiple paragraphs may be included.

In particular, descriptions should include information that does not fit into structured metadata, and focus on the “what”, “when”, and “where” information, general taxonomic information, as well as whether the data package is ongoing or completed.

Some general methods description is appropriate, and broad classes of measured parameters should also be included.  For a large number of parameters, use categories instead of listing all parameters (e.g. use the term “nutrients” instead of nitrate, phosphate, calcium, etc.), in combination with the parameters that seem most relevant for search.

An abstract is not required, but it is highly recommended.
--------------------
add_load_data_tables
Add/Load Data Tables
You can create a data table's metadata "from scratch" via <b>Add Data Table</b>, or you can load an existing data table CSV file via <b>Load Data Table</b>.

In the latter case, many of the data table's characteristics will be automatically extracted or inferred from the file, but others will still need to be entered or modified manually.
--------------------
add_load_other_entities
Add/Load Other Entities
You can create an other entity's metadata "from scratch" via <b>Add Other Entity</b>, or you can load an existing other entity file via <b>Load Other Entity</b>.

In the latter case, a number of the other entity's characteristics will be automatically extracted or inferred from the file, but others will still need to be entered or modified manually.
--------------------
associated_parties
Associated Parties
Associated parties are other people who were involved with the data in some way (field technicians, students, assistants, etc.).

Associated parties are not required.
--------------------
award
Funding Award
Information on a funding award associated with the project.

Required fields are provided for the name of the funding agency and the title of the award.

Optional fields are provided as well for the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award, the award number assigned, and the URL to the award page describing the award.
--------------------
award_number
Award Number
The unique identifier used by the funder to uniquely identify an award.

These are typically alphanumeric values that are unique within the system used by a given funder. The number should be listed using the canonical form that each funder uses to express its award numbers and should not be prefixed or postfixed with extra text such as the acronym of the funder or the name of the funder, which is available instead in the Funder Name field.
--------------------
award_title
Award Title
The title of the award or grant. This field is required.

Example:  Scientia Arctica: A Knowledge Archive for Discovery and Reproducible Science in the Arctic
--------------------
award_url
Award URL
The URL associated with award.

Typically, the Award URL is use to find and locate the award, and it generally addresses the internet location to find out more information about the award.

It should point to a funder site for the award, rather than a project site.
--------------------
awards
Funding Awards
The funding awards for the project.

Each funding award is described by the name of the funding agency and the title of the award.

Optional fields are provided as well for the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award, the award number assigned, and the URL to the award page describing the award.
--------------------
bounding_coordinates
Bounding Coordinates
<b>Bounding Coordinates</b> are the four margins (N, S, E, W) of a bounding box, or when considered in lat-lon pairs, the corners of the box. These elements are meant to convey general information and are not for accurate mapping.

The limits of coverage of a data set should be expressed as <b>decimal latitudes and longitudes</b>. By convention, latitudes and longitudes are referenced to the Equator and to the Prime Meridian, respectively. By definition, the 0 and 180 meridians themselves do not belong in either hemisphere, but local conventions may place them in either.

All coordinates are typed as decimals. Since all four elements are required, a bounding area that is a single point should use the same values for North Bounding Coordinate and South Bounding Coordinate, and likewise for West Bounding Coordinate and East Bounding Coordinate.

In the case of a data set that comprises all longitudes (e.g., a horizontal band between 2 parallels that fully encompasses the earth), use a West Bounding Coordinate of -180.0 and an eastBoundingCoordinate of 180.0 (or +180.0).
--------------------
contacts
Contacts
At least one <b>Contact</b> is required.

Full contact information should be included for the position of data manager or other designated contact and should be kept current and independent of personnel changes. If multiple contacts are listed (e.g. both a data and site manager) all should be kept current. Technicians who performed the work belong under <b>Associated Party</b> rather than <b>Contact</b>.
--------------------
contents
Contents	
You can use ezEML as a "wizard" (i.e., by proceeding through the sections in sequence, filling out the metadata as you go), or you can click on any of the links under <b>Contents</b> to jump directly to that section of the metadata.
--------------------
creators
Creators
The creator is considered to be the author of the data package, i.e. the person(s) responsible for intellectual input into its creation. At least one creator is required.

For long-term data, e.g., from an LTER Site, we recommend that you include the organization or current principal investigator. It should be kept in mind that searchers frequently default to searches using the PI’s last name. Therefore it is a reasonable practice to include more creators rather than fewer, even if it blurs the credit for long-term data.
--------------------
data_tables
Data Tables
A data table is one tabular entity in the data package, identified by its name. The data table descriptor can contain information about the data table's orientation, number of records, case sensitivity, and temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage.
--------------------
data_table
Data Table
A data table is one tabular entity in the data package, identified by its name. The data table descriptor can contain information about the data table's orientation, number of records, case sensitivity, and temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage.
--------------------
data_table_name
Data Table Name
The name identifies the data table in the data package.

Example: SpeciesAbundance1996
--------------------
data_table_description
Data Table Description
Text generally describing the data table and relevant information about its contents.

Example: Species abundance data for 1996 at the VCR LTER
--------------------
data_table_object_name
Data Object Name
The name of the data object that is the source of the data table. It usually is the filename of a file in a file system or that is accessible on the network.
--------------------
data_table_attribute_orientation
Attribute Orientation
Specifies whether the data attributes are organized in columns or rows.
--------------------
data_table_field_delimiter
Field Delimiter
Specifies the character used in the data object for delimiting data values.
--------------------
data_table_size
Size
The size of the data object, in bytes.
--------------------
data_table_checksum
MD5 Checksum
The checksum for the data object, calculated using the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
--------------------
data_table_header_lines
Number of Header Lines
The number of header lines preceding the data. I.e., the number of header lines that should be skipped before starting to parse the data.
--------------------
data_table_record_delimiter
Record Delimiter
Character(s) used to delimit records (e.g., rows).

The record delimiter is usually a linefeed (\n) on UNIX, a carriage return (\r) on MacOS, or both (\r\n) on Windows/DOS.
--------------------
data_table_case_sensitive
Case Sensitive
Specifies text case sensitivity of the data in the data table. The valid values are yes or no.

If it is set to yes, then values of attributes that differ only in case (e.g.,LOW, low) represent distinct values. If set to no, then values of attributes that differ only in case represent the same value.
--------------------
data_table_number_of_records
Number of Records
The integer count of the number of records in the data table.

It should only include records that represent observations. I.e., it would not include any details of physical formatting such as the number of header lines.
--------------------
data_table_online_url
Online Distribution URL
If the data table is available online, its URL address.
--------------------
funder_identifiers
Funder Identifier(s)
One or more canonical identifiers that reference the funder. If entering more than one identifier, separate them by commas.

These identifiers should be globally unique. The most common form of a funder identifier is a DOI identifier of an institution or program drawn from the CrossRef Open Funder Registry (https://github.com/Crossref/open-funder-registry), which assigns DOIs to each funding agency and to their programs and links these together in a navigable hierarchy.
--------------------
funder_name
Funder Name
The name of the funding institution, with fully expanded acronyms to show the full, official name of the funding agency. This field is required.

In general, this should match the official name of the funder as listed in an Authority such as the Open Funder Registry.
--------------------
geographic_coverages
Geographic Coverage
<b>Geographic Coverage</b> describes locations of research sites and areas related to the data, and is intended for general placement of points on a map.

At least one <b>Geographic Coverage</b> element should be included, whose bounding coordinates describe the extent of the data. As a default, this could be the nominal boundaries of a sampling area. A more accurate extent (recommended) would be the maximum extent of the data, for each of north, south, east, and west.

Additional <b>Geographic Coverage</b> elements should be included if there are significant distances between study sites and grouping them in one bounding box would be misleading or confusing. For example, a cross-site study should have bounding boxes for each site.
--------------------
geographic_description
Geographic Description
<b>Geographic Description</b> is a short text description of a data package's geographic areal domain. A text description is especially important to provide a geographic setting when the extent of the data set cannot be well described by the "bounding coordinates", or in the case of data which are not specifically geospatial.

In cases where the "bounding coordinates" do not adequately describe the extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and described here.

The coordinates may define a rectangle around a country, with this Geographic Description containing a disclaimer and/or further details concerning the border. E.g., a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon were collected in the states of Washington and Oregon. The "bounding coordinates" might form a general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the Geographic Description" might describe the fact that the study actually took place only along certain rivers within those states.

Geographic Description can also contain information about the collection of bounding coordinates, e.g., an altitude value that is referenced to Mean Lower Low Water, or the projection system that the latitude and longitude coordinates were taken from.</para>

Import Responsible Parties
You may import the details for one or more responsible parties (persons, organizations, or positions) who have been specified as Creators, Contacts, etc. in another data package. This saves you from having re-enter their details.

The parties you import do not have to be used for the same purpose in this data package for which they were used in the other data package. For example, a person who was a Contact in another data package can be imported into this data package as an Associated Party.

<b>Note that you may also "import" from the current data package, for example to re-use one or more Creators as Contacts or Project Personnel.</b>
--------------------
import_responsible_parties_2
Import Responsible Parties
Select the responsible parties (persons, organizations, positions) whose details you wish to import, and select how they will be used in the current data package, i.e., as Creators, Metadata Providers, Associated Parties, Contacts, or Project Personnel.

If none are listed, none are available in the selected data package.
--------------------
intellectual_rights
Intellectual Rights
Intellectual rights are controlled at the source, however it is recommended that data be released with as few restrictions as possible.

EDI's default policy is <b>CC0</b>. The LTER Network-wide default policy is <b>CC BY</b>. Please consult those organizations for more information and more details.
This includes information about the frequency of update and whether there is ongoing data collection.
--------------------
keywords
Keywords
It is recommended that meaningful sets of keywords be provided.

One set of keywords may identify the contributing organization(s), e.g., the LTER or OBFS site, LTREB or Macrosystems project, especially if data are co-funded or funding is leveraged.

Meaningful geographic place names also are appropriate (e.g. state, city, county).

Note: Communities sometimes have specific requests for keywords to assist in searches. E.g, the LTER requests that keywords should include LTER core research area(s), the network acronym (LTER, ILTER, etc.), three-letter site acronym and site name. In addition to specific keywords, relevant conceptual keywords should also be included, e.g., from the LTER Controlled Vocabulary.

It may consist of multiple paragraphs.
--------------------
maintenance_freq
Maintenance Update Frequency
Frequency with which changes and additions are made to the dataset after the initial dataset is completed.
--------------------
metadata_providers
Metadata Providers
The metadata provider is the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for producing or providing the metadata content.

For primary data sets generated by LTER sites, the LTER site should typically be listed under Metadata Provider using the Organization Name field. For acquired data sets, where the Creator and Associated Party are not the same people who produced the metadata content, the actual metadata content provider should be listed instead.
--------------------
measurement_scale
Variable Type
Attributes (variables) can have the following types: Categorical, Numerical, Text, or DateTime.

<b>Categorical</b> variables contain alphanumeric codes used to categorize data. Examples of categorical variables are 1 for Male and 2 for Female, or M for Male and F for Female. Some categorical variable codes convey an order (e.g., Low, Medium, High), others do not.

<b>Numerical</b> variables contain ordinary numerical data, i.e., numerical values not used for categorization. Values may be integers (e.g., counts of specimens) or real numbers (e.g., temperature, pH). Units are required for all numerical variables.

<b>Text</b> variables contain text values not used for categorization. Examples include names or identification numbers of experimental subjects.

<b>DateTime</b> variables contain date and time values. Note that time <i>durations</i> should be treated as Numerical values.
--------------------
metadata_providers
Metadata Providers
The metadata provider is the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for producing or providing the metadata content.

Metadata providers are not required.
--------------------
methods
Method Steps
Method steps are descriptions of specific steps of the method employed when collecting data. They are intended to be descriptive, i.e., human-readable rather than machine-readable.

The method steps document a series of procedures followed to produce a data object. These may include text descriptions of the procedures, relevant literature, software, instrumentation, source data and any quality control measures taken.
--------------------
method_step_description
Method Step Description
Description of the methods employed in collecting or generating a data set or other resource or in quality control and assurance.

Describe the methodology for a project, experiment, or particular data table or the steps taken to control or assure the quality of the data. Likewise, a literature citation may be provided that describes the methodology that was employed. Or the information my be provided by either referencing a protocol resource or entering the structured protocol information.
--------------------
method_step_instrumentation
Method Step Instrumentation
Description of instruments used for measurement and recording data.

This may include any instruments used in the data collection or quality control and quality assurance. The description should provide vendor, model number, optional equipment, etc.

Example: LACHAT analyzer, model XYX.
--------------------
name_org_position
Last Name, Organization, Position Name
place holder
--------------------
nav
Navigating in ezEML
The <b>Save and Continue</b> button saves the changes you've made on the current page and moves you ahead to the next section of the metadata. You can step through the sections sequentially using <b>Save and Continue</b>, or you can click any of the links under <b>Contents</b> in the left margin to save changes and jump directly to another section of the metadata.

The <b>Reset Changes</b> button clears the changes you've made on the current page and leaves you on that page.

<b>It's best to refrain from using your browser's forward and back buttons. Using them may cause you to lose unsaved edits.</b>
--------------------
new_eml_document
New EML Document
An EML document is identified by a data package identifier.

A data package identifier is of the form <i>scope.identifier.revision</i>. I.e., it consists of three parts, separated by periods(.).

The first part, the <b>scope</b>, is text; e.g., edi, knb-lter-sbc, or my-contacts. The second part, the <b>identifier</b>, is an integer, that identifies the package within the scope. The third part, the <b>revision</b>, is an integer that identifies the particular revision of a data package.
--------------------
other_entities
Other Entities
<b>Other Entities</b> are data entities other than data tables. They are identitied by their names.

<b>Other Entities</b> descriptors can contain information about an entity's basic identity, its temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, and its type.

Example: Photograph of rocky intertidal plot 12 from Santa Cruz
--------------------
pubdate
Publication Date
The year or date of public release of data online.

Because this element may be used in constructing citations, the publication date also should  reflect the 'recentness' of a package. I.e., it should be updated along with significant revisions or data additions (e.g., corrected data or additions to an ongoing time series).

There is an argument for publication date referring to the original date of release, but this is probably only useful for static data packages, or if the only metadata changes are to enhance discovery.
--------------------
publisher
Publisher
The organization producing the EML metadata (e.g., an LTER site or field station).

Publisher is not required by EML. If you submit your data to the EDI data repository, EDI will be entered automatically as the publisher in the published EML.
--------------------
pubplace
Publication Place
The location where the resource was published, which may be different from where the resource was created.

Example: Madison, WI, USA
--------------------
pubdate
Publication Date
The date of publication.

Publication date is not required by EML. If you submit your data to the EDI data repository, the date of publication will be entered automatically by EDI.
--------------------
project
Project
This documents the research context of a data package or another project. It can include research goals, motivations, theory, hypotheses, etc., as well as a description of research efforts that form the basis for other work.

To document <i>methods</i> specific to a data package, use <b>Methods</b>.
--------------------
project_title
Project Title
A descriptive title for the research project.

Example: Species diversity in Tennessee riparian habitats.
--------------------
taxonomic_coverages
Taxonomic Coverage
<b>Taxonomic Coverage</b> should be used to document taxonomic information for all organisms relevant to the study.

The lowest available level, preferably the species binomial and common name should always be included, but higher-level taxa should also be included to support broader taxonomic searches.
--------------------
temporal_coverages
Temporal Coverage
<b>Temporal Coverage</b> represents the period of time the data were collected, not the year the study was conducted if it uses retrospective or historical data.

Two formats are allowed, either a 4-digit year, or a date in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD.
--------------------
title
Title
The <b>Title</b> field provides a description of the data package. It should be long enough to differentiate it from other similar resources. A minimum of 20 characters is required.

It should be descriptive and should mention the data collected, geographic context, research site, and time frame (i.e., what, where, and when).

Example: <i>Vernal pool amphibian density data, Isla Vista, 1990-1996.</i>
--------------------
