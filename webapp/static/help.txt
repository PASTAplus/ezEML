You can use the Metadata Editor as a "wizard" (i.e., by proceeding through the sections in sequence, filling out the metadata as you go), or you can click on any of the links under <b>Contents</b> to jump directly to that section of the metadata.

Navigating in the Metadata Editor
The <b>Save and Continue</b> button saves the changes you've made on the current page and moves you ahead to the next page. You can step through the pages sequentially using <b>Save and Continue</b>, or you can click any of the links under <b>Contents</b> in the left margin to jump directly to a particular section of the metadata.

The <b>Reset</b> button clears the changes you've made on the current page and leaves you on that page.

Please refrain from using your browser's forward and back buttons. Using them may cause you to lose some of your edits.
--------------------
title
Title
The <b>Title</b> field provides a description of the data package. It should be long enough to differentiate it from other similar resources. A minimum of 20 characters is required.

It should be descriptive and should mention the data collected, geographic context, research site, and time frame (i.e., what, where, and when).

Example: <i>Vernal pool amphibian density data, Isla Vista, 1990-1996.</i>
--------------------
creators
Creators
The creator is considered to be the author of the data package, i.e. the person(s) responsible for intellectual input into its creation.

For long-term data, e.g., from an LTER Site, we recommend that you include the organization or current principal investigator. It should be kept in mind that searchers frequently default to searches using the PI’s last name. Therefore it is a reasonable practice to include more creators rather than fewer, even if it blurs the credit for long-term data.
--------------------
metadata_providers
Metadata Providers
The metadata provider is the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for producing or providing the metadata content.

For primary data sets generated by LTER sites, the LTER site should typically be listed under Metadata Provider using the Organization Name field. For acquired data sets, where the Creator and Associated Party are not the same people who produced the metadata content, the actual metadata content provider should be listed instead.
--------------------
associated_parties
Associated Parties
Associated parties are other people who were involved with the data in some way (field technicians, students, assistants, etc.).
--------------------
contacts
Contacts
A <b>Contact</b> is required in all EML metadata records.

Full contact information should be included for the position of data manager or other designated contact and should be kept current and independent of personnel changes. If multiple contacts are listed (e.g. both a data and site manager) all should be kept current. Technicians who performed the work belong under <b>Associated Party</b> rather than <b>Contact</b>.
--------------------
pubdate
Publication Date
The year or date of public release of data online.

Because this element may be used in constructing citations, the publication date also should  reflect the 'recentness' of a package. I.e., it should be updated along with significant revisions
 or data additions (e.g., corrected data or additions to an ongoing time series).

There is an argument for publication date referring to the original date of release, but this is probably only useful for static data packages, or if the only metadata changes are to enhance discovery.
--------------------
abstract
Abstract
The <b>Abstract</b> will be used for full-text searches, and it should be rich with descriptive text.

In particular, descriptions should include information that does not fit into structured metadata, and focus on the “what”, “when”, and “where” information, general taxonomic information, as well as whether the dataset is ongoing or completed.

Some general methods description is appropriate, and broad classes of measured parameters should also be included.  For a large number of parameters, use categories instead of listing all parameters (e.g. use the term “nutrients” instead of nitrate, phosphate, calcium, etc.), in combination with the parameters that seem most relevant for search.
--------------------
keywords
Keywords
It is recommended that meaningful sets of keywords be provided.

One set of keywords may identify the contributing organization(s), e.g., the LTER or OBFS site, LTREB or Macrosystems project, which is especially if data are co-funded or funding is leveraged.

Meaningful geographic place names also are appropriate (e.g. state, city, county).

Note: Communities sometimes have specific requests for keywords to assist in searches. E.g, the LTER requests that keywords should include LTER core research area(s), the network acronym (LTER, ILTER, etc.), three-letter site acronym and site name. In addition to specific keywords, relevant conceptual keywords should also be included, e.g., from the LTER Controlled Vocabulary.
--------------------
intellectual_rights
Intellectual Rights
Intellectual rights are controlled at the source, however it is recommended that data be released with as few restrictions as possible.

EDI's default policy is <b>CC0</b>. The LTER Network-wide default policy is <b>CC BY</b>. Please consult those organizations for more information and more details.
--------------------
geographic_coverages
Geographic Coverage
<b>Geographic Coverage</b> describes locations of research sites and areas related to the data, and is intended for general placement of points on a map.

At least one <b>Geographic Coverage</b> element should be included, whose bounding coordinates describe the extent of the data. As a default, this could be the nominal boundaries of a sampling area. A more accurate extent (recommended) would be the maximum extent of the data, for each of north, south, east, and west.

Additional <b>Geographic Coverage</b> elements should be included if there are significant distances between study sites and grouping them in one bounding box would be misleading or confusing. For example, a cross-site study should have bounding boxes for each site.
--------------------
temporal_coverages
Temporal Coverage
<b>Temporal Coverage</b> represents the period of time the data were collected, not the year the study was conducted if it uses retrospective or historical data.

Two formats are allowed, either a 4-digit year, or a date in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD.
--------------------
taxonomic_coverages
Taxonomic Coverage
<b>Taxonomic Coverage</b> should be used to document taxonomic information for all organisms relevant to the study.

The lowest available level, preferably the species binomial and common name should always be included, but higher-level taxa should also be included to support broader taxonomic searches.
--------------------
publisher
Publisher
The organization producing the EML metadata (e.g., an LTER site or field station).
--------------------
pubplace
Publication Place
The location where the resource was published, which may be different from where the resource was created.

Example: Madison, WI, USA
--------------------
methods
Method Steps
Method steps are descriptions of specific steps of the method employed when collecting data. They are intended to be descriptive, i.e., human-readable rather than machine-readable.

The method steps document a series of procedures followed to produce a data object. These may include text descriptions of the procedures, relevant literature, software, instrumentation, source data and any quality control measures taken.
