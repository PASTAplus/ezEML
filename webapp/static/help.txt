abstract
Abstract
The <b>Abstract</b> will be used for full-text searches, and it should be rich with descriptive text. Multiple paragraphs may be included.

In particular, descriptions should include information that does not fit into structured metadata, and focus on the “what”, “when”, and “where” information, general taxonomic information, as well as whether the dataset is ongoing or completed.

Some general methods description is appropriate, and broad classes of measured parameters should also be included.  For a large number of parameters, use categories instead of listing all parameters (e.g. use the term “nutrients” instead of nitrate, phosphate, calcium, etc.), in combination with the parameters that seem most relevant for search.
--------------------
add_load_data_tables
Add/Load Data Tables
You can create a data table's metadata "from scratch" via <b>Add Data Table</b>, or you can load an existing data table CSV file via <b>Load Data Table</b>.

In the latter case, many of the data table's characteristics will be automatically extracted or inferred from the file, but others will still need to be entered or modified manually.
--------------------
add_load_other_entities
Add/Load Other Entities
You can create an other entity's metadata "from scratch" via <b>Add Other Entity</b>, or you can load an existing other entity file via <b>Load Other Entity</b>.

In the latter case, a number of the other entity's characteristics will be automatically extracted or inferred from the file, but others will still need to be entered or modified manually.
--------------------
associated_parties
Associated Parties
Associated parties are other people who were involved with the data in some way (field technicians, students, assistants, etc.).
--------------------
award
Funding Award
Information on a funding award associated with the project.

Required fields are provided for the name of the funding agency and the title of the award.

Optional fields are provided as well for the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award, the award number assigned, and the URL to the award page describing the award.
--------------------
award_number
Award Number
The unique identifier used by the funder to uniquely identify an award.

These are typically alphanumeric values that are unique within the system used by a given funder. The number should be listed using the canonical form that each funder uses to express its award numbers and should not be prefixed or postfixed with extra text such as the acronym of the funder or the name of the funder, which is available instead in the Funder Name field.
--------------------
award_title
Award Title
The title of the award or grant. This field is required.

Example:  Scientia Arctica: A Knowledge Archive for Discovery and Reproducible Science in the Arctic
--------------------
award_url
Award URL
The URL associated with award.

Typically, the Award URL is use to find and locate the award, and it generally addresses the internet location to find out more information about the award.

It should point to a funder site for the award, rather than a project site.
--------------------
awards
Funding Awards
The funding awards for the project.

Each funding award is described by the name of the funding agency and the title of the award.

Optional fields are provided as well for the Open Funder Registry identifiers for the agency and program that made the award, the award number assigned, and the URL to the award page describing the award.
--------------------
bounding_coordinates
Bounding Coordinates
<b>Bounding Coordinates</b> are the four margins (N, S, E, W) of a bounding box, or when considered in lat-lon pairs, the corners of the box. These elements are meant to convey general information and are not for accurate mapping.

The limits of coverage of a data set should be expressed as <b>decimal latitudes and longitudes</b>. By convention, latitudes and longitudes are referenced to the Equator and to the Prime Meridian, respectively. By definition, the 0 and 180 meridians themselves do not belong in either hemisphere, but local conventions may place them in either.

All coordinates are typed as decimals. Since all four elements are required, a bounding area that is a single point should use the same values for North Bounding Coordinate and South Bounding Coordinate, and likewise for West Bounding Coordinate and East Bounding Coordinate.

In the case of a data set that comprises all longitudes (e.g., a horizontal band between 2 parallels that fully encompasses the earth), use a West Bounding Coordinate of -180.0 and an eastBoundingCoordinate of 180.0 (or +180.0).
--------------------
contacts
Contacts
A <b>Contact</b> is required in all EML metadata records.

Full contact information should be included for the position of data manager or other designated contact and should be kept current and independent of personnel changes. If multiple contacts are listed (e.g. both a data and site manager) all should be kept current. Technicians who performed the work belong under <b>Associated Party</b> rather than <b>Contact</b>.
--------------------
contents
Contents	
You can use ezEML as a "wizard" (i.e., by proceeding through the sections in sequence, filling out the metadata as you go), or you can click on any of the links under <b>Contents</b> to jump directly to that section of the metadata.
--------------------
creators
Creators
The creator is considered to be the author of the data package, i.e. the person(s) responsible for intellectual input into its creation.

For long-term data, e.g., from an LTER Site, we recommend that you include the organization or current principal investigator. It should be kept in mind that searchers frequently default to searches using the PI’s last name. Therefore it is a reasonable practice to include more creators rather than fewer, even if it blurs the credit for long-term data.
--------------------
data_tables
Data Tables
A data table is one tabular entity in the dataset, identified by its name. The data table descriptor can contain information about the data table's orientation, number of records, case sensitivity, and temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage.
--------------------
funder_identifiers
Funder Identifier(s)
One or more canonical identifiers that reference the funder. If entering more than one identifier, separate them by commas.

These identifiers should be globally unique. The most common form of a funder identifier is a DOI identifier of an institution or program drawn from the CrossRef Open Funder Registry (https://github.com/Crossref/open-funder-registry), which assigns DOIs to each funding agency and to their programs and links these together in a navigable hierarchy.
--------------------
funder_name
Funder Name
The name of the funding institution, with fully expanded acronyms to show the full, official name of the funding agency. This field is required.

In general, this should match the official name of the funder as listed in an Authority such as the Open Funder Registry.
--------------------
geographic_coverages
Geographic Coverage
<b>Geographic Coverage</b> describes locations of research sites and areas related to the data, and is intended for general placement of points on a map.

At least one <b>Geographic Coverage</b> element should be included, whose bounding coordinates describe the extent of the data. As a default, this could be the nominal boundaries of a sampling area. A more accurate extent (recommended) would be the maximum extent of the data, for each of north, south, east, and west.

Additional <b>Geographic Coverage</b> elements should be included if there are significant distances between study sites and grouping them in one bounding box would be misleading or confusing. For example, a cross-site study should have bounding boxes for each site.
--------------------
geographic_description
Geographic Description
<b>Geographic Description</b> is a short text description of a dataset's geographic areal domain. A text description is especially important to provide a geographic setting when the extent of the data set cannot be well described by the "bounding coordinates", or in the case of data which are not specifically geospatial.

In cases where the "bounding coordinates" do not adequately describe the extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and described here.

The coordinates may define a rectangle around a country, with this Geographic Description containing a disclaimer and/or further details concerning the border. E.g., a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon were collected in the states of Washington and Oregon. The "bounding coordinates" might form a general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the Geographic Description" might describe the fact that the study actually took place only along certain rivers within those states.

Geographic Description can also contain information about the collection of bounding coordinates, e.g., an altitude value that is referenced to Mean Lower Low Water, or the projection system that the latitude and longitude coordinates were taken from.</para>
--------------------
intellectual_rights
Intellectual Rights
Intellectual rights are controlled at the source, however it is recommended that data be released with as few restrictions as possible.

EDI's default policy is <b>CC0</b>. The LTER Network-wide default policy is <b>CC BY</b>. Please consult those organizations for more information and more details.
This includes information about the frequency of update and whether there is ongoing data collection.
--------------------
keywords
Keywords
It is recommended that meaningful sets of keywords be provided.

One set of keywords may identify the contributing organization(s), e.g., the LTER or OBFS site, LTREB or Macrosystems project, especially if data are co-funded or funding is leveraged.

Meaningful geographic place names also are appropriate (e.g. state, city, county).

Note: Communities sometimes have specific requests for keywords to assist in searches. E.g, the LTER requests that keywords should include LTER core research area(s), the network acronym (LTER, ILTER, etc.), three-letter site acronym and site name. In addition to specific keywords, relevant conceptual keywords should also be included, e.g., from the LTER Controlled Vocabulary.
--------------------
maintenance
Maintenance
A description of the maintenance of this data resource.

This includes information about the frequency of update and whether there is ongoing data collection.
--------------------
maintenance_description
Maintenance Description
A text description of the maintenance of this data resource.

It may consist of multiple paragraphs.
--------------------
maintenance_freq
Maintenance Update Frequency
Frequency with which changes and additions are made to the dataset after the initial dataset is completed.metadata_providers
Metadata Providers
The metadata provider is the person(s) or organization(s) responsible for producing or providing the metadata content.

For primary data sets generated by LTER sites, the LTER site should typically be listed under Metadata Provider using the Organization Name field. For acquired data sets, where the Creator and Associated Party are not the same people who produced the metadata content, the actual metadata content provider should be listed instead.
--------------------
measurement_scale
Variable Type
Attributes (variables) can have the following types: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio, or DateTime.

<b>Nominal</b> refers to variables containing alphanumeric codes used for the purpose of categorizing data. An example of a nominal scale is 1 for Male and 2 for Female, or M for Male and F for Female. Alternatively, a nominal variable can contain simple text (as opposed to coded values). Examples of the latter include names or ID numbers of experimental subjects.

<b>Ordinal</b> values are also used for categorization, but here the categories have a logical or ordered relationship to each other. An <b>ordinal</b> scale lets one distinguish the <i>order</i> of values, but not the magnitude of differences between values. An example of an ordinal scale is a categorical survey that ranks a variable 1=good, 2=fair, 3=poor.

<b>Interval</b> values are measured in reference to equidistant points on a continuous scale. The Celsius scale is an interval scale, since each degree difference is equal to every other, but there is no natural zero point (so, 20 C is not twice as hot as 10 C).

<b>Ratio</b> values are also measured in reference to a continuous scale that has equidistant values, but here the scale has a meaningful zero point. This allows ratios to have meaning: e.g., it make sense to say one value is twice as great as another. Examples of ratio scales are the Kelvin temperature scale (200K is half as hot as 400K) and length in meters (10 meters is twice as long as 5 meters).

<b>DateTime</b> variables contain date and time values. Note that time <i>durations</i> should be treated as Interval or Ratio values.
--------------------
methods
Method Steps
Method steps are descriptions of specific steps of the method employed when collecting data. They are intended to be descriptive, i.e., human-readable rather than machine-readable.

The method steps document a series of procedures followed to produce a data object. These may include text descriptions of the procedures, relevant literature, software, instrumentation, source data and any quality control measures taken.
--------------------
nav
Navigating in ezEML
The <b>Save and Continue</b> button saves the changes you've made on the current page and moves you ahead to the next page. You can step through the pages sequentially using <b>Save and Continue</b>, or you can click any of the links under <b>Contents</b> in the left margin to jump directly to a particular section of the metadata.

The <b>Reset</b> button clears the changes you've made on the current page and leaves you on that page.

<b>Please refrain from using your browser's forward and back buttons. Using them may cause you to lose some of your edits.</b>
--------------------
other_entities
Other Entities
<b>Other Entities</b> are data entities other than data tables. They are identitied by their names.

<b>Other Entities</b> descriptors can contain information about an entity's basic identity, its temporal, geographic, and taxonomic coverage, and its type.

Example: Photograph of rocky intertidal plot 12 from Santa Cruz
--------------------
pubdate
Publication Date
The year or date of public release of data online.

Because this element may be used in constructing citations, the publication date also should  reflect the 'recentness' of a package. I.e., it should be updated along with significant revisions
 or data additions (e.g., corrected data or additions to an ongoing time series).

There is an argument for publication date referring to the original date of release, but this is probably only useful for static data packages, or if the only metadata changes are to enhance discovery.
--------------------
publisher
Publisher
The organization producing the EML metadata (e.g., an LTER site or field station).
--------------------
pubplace
Publication Place
The location where the resource was published, which may be different from where the resource was created.

Example: Madison, WI, USA
--------------------
project
Project
Documents the research context of a dataset or another project. It can include research goals, motivations, theory, hypotheses, etc., as well as a description of research efforts that form the basis for other work.

To document methods specific to a dataset, use <b>Methods</b>.
--------------------
project_title
Project Title
A descriptive title for the research project.

Example: Species diversity in Tennessee riparian habitats.
--------------------
taxonomic_coverages
Taxonomic Coverage
<b>Taxonomic Coverage</b> should be used to document taxonomic information for all organisms relevant to the study.

The lowest available level, preferably the species binomial and common name should always be included, but higher-level taxa should also be included to support broader taxonomic searches.
--------------------
temporal_coverages
Temporal Coverage
<b>Temporal Coverage</b> represents the period of time the data were collected, not the year the study was conducted if it uses retrospective or historical data.

Two formats are allowed, either a 4-digit year, or a date in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD.
--------------------
title
Title
The <b>Title</b> field provides a description of the data package. It should be long enough to differentiate it from other similar resources. A minimum of 20 characters is required.

It should be descriptive and should mention the data collected, geographic context, research site, and time frame (i.e., what, where, and when).

Example: <i>Vernal pool amphibian density data, Isla Vista, 1990-1996.</i>
