Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H).

Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance, and impedance, respectively. To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm. In other words, the conductance, susceptance, or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms.

A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) \(0\,decibel\) is equal to \(1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared\). This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing. For sound pressure (the pressure exerted by the sound waves) 0 decibels equals \(20\,micropascals\,RMS\), and for sound power \(0\,decibels\) sometimes equals \(1\,picoWatt\).

One gram is now defined to be 1/1000 of the mass of the standard kilogram, a platinum-iridium bar carefully guarded by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris for more than a century.

As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars.

In mechanical terms, one watt equals about 0.001 341 02 horsepower (hp) or 0.737 562 foot-pound per second (lbf/s). In electrical terms, one watt is the power produced by a current of one ampere flowing through an electric potential of one volt.

The parsec measurement unit is used in astronomy. It is defined as the length of the adjacent side of an imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions that specify this triangle are the parallax angle (defined as 1 arcsecond) and the opposite side (defined as 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Given these two measurements, along with the rules of trigonometry, the length of the adjacent side (the parsec) can be found.",0

The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).  This corresponds to a value of \(6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}\) elementary entities of the substance. It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol \(mol\). A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object.

It is a convenient unit for referring to the area of a wire with a circular cross section, because the area in circular mils can be calculated without reference to pi (\(\pi\)). The area in circular mils, A, of a circle with a diameter of d mils, is given by the formula: Electricians in Canada and the United States are familiar with the circular mil because the National Electrical Code (NEC) uses the circular mil to define wire sizes larger than 0000 AWG. In many NEC publications and uses, large wires may be expressed in thousands of circular mils, which is abbreviated in two different ways: MCM or kcmil. For example, one common wire size used in the NEC has a cross-section of 250,000 circular mils, written as 250 kcmil or 250 MCM, which is the first size larger than 0000 AWG used within the NEC.",0

A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H). The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents. \(\text{H} \; \equiv \; \text{henry}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{weber}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \frac{\text{V}\cdot\text{s}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{volt} \cdot \text{second}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \Omega\cdot\text{s}\; \equiv\; \text{ohm.second}\)",0

The gram was originally defined to be the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water, but to provide precise standards it was necessary to construct physical objects of specified mass. One gram is now defined to be 1/1000 of the mass of the standard kilogram, a platinum-iridium bar carefully guarded by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris for more than a century. (The kilogram, rather than the gram, is considered the base unit of mass in the SI.) The gram is a small mass, equal to about 15.432 grains or 0.035 273 966 ounce.",NA,0

The better the insulator, the larger the charge that the conductors can hold. This property of a circuit is called capacitance, and it is measured in farads. One farad is defined as the ability to store one coulomb of charge per volt of potential difference between the two conductors. This is a natural definition, but the unit it defines is very large. In practical circuits, capacitance is often measured in microfarads, nanofarads, or sometimes even in picofarads (10-12 farad, or trillionths of a farad).

A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) \(0\,decibel\) is equal to \(1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared\). This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing. For sound pressure (the pressure exerted by the sound waves) 0 decibels equals \(20\,micropascals\,RMS\), and for sound power \(0\,decibels\) sometimes equals \(1\,picoWatt\).

A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) \(0\,decibel\) is equal to \(1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared\). This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing. For sound pressure (the pressure exerted by the sound waves) 0 decibels equals \(20\,micropascals\,RMS\), and for sound power \(0\,decibels\) sometimes equals \(1\,picoWatt\).

Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>",NA,0

The abbreviation \(kn\) is preferred by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), which includes every major sea-faring nation; however, the abbreviations kt (singular) and kts (plural) are also widely used. However, use of the abbreviation kt for knot conflicts with the SI symbol for kilotonne. The knot is a non-SI unit accepted for use with the International System of Units (SI). Worldwide, the knot is used in meteorology, and in maritime and air navigation - for example, a vessel travelling at 1 knot along a meridian travels one minute of geographic latitude in one hour. Etymologically, the term knot derives from counting the number of knots in the line that unspooled from the reel of a chip log in a specific time.",0

The area in circular mils, A, of a circle with a diameter of d mils, is given by the formula: Electricians in Canada and the United States are familiar with the circular mil because the National Electrical Code (NEC) uses the circular mil to define wire sizes larger than 0000 AWG. In many NEC publications and uses, large wires may be expressed in thousands of circular mils, which is abbreviated in two different ways: MCM or kcmil. For example, one common wire size used in the NEC has a cross-section of 250,000 circular mils, written as 250 kcmil or 250 MCM, which is the first size larger than 0000 AWG used within the NEC.",0
