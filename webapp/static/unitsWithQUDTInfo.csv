  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,
   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).
  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:

  $$\text{pH}=-\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\equiv-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)$$

  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of
   the hydrogen ion in the solution.
  $$$$
  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\ mol/l$, 
   where $aH+ \equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\ mol/L\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.
  $$$$
  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\circ$), typically taken as $1 \ mol/kg$, 
   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.
  $$$$
  The activity can be expressed as:

  $$a_{H^+} = \gamma_{H^+} \times m_{H^+}$$ 

  Where, $\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for
   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.
  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, 
   expressed in $mol/kg$.
  $$$$
  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:

  $$\text{pH} = -log_{10}\left(m_{H+}\times\gamma_{H^+}\right)$$

  $$$$
  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. 
  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.
  $$$$
  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,
  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high
  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.
  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.

  The unit $\textit{Kelvin}$ is the SI base unit of temperature, previously called the degree Kelvin. 
  One kelvin represents the same temperature difference as one degree Celsius. 
  In 1967 the General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the temperature of the triple point of water
   (the temperature at which water exists simultaneously in the gaseous, liquid, and solid states) to be exactly 273.16 kelvins. 
  Since this temperature is also equal to 0.01 u00b0C, the temperature in kelvins is always equal to 273.15 plus the temperature in degrees Celsius. 
  The kelvin equals exactly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  The unit is named for the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson (1824-1907),
   later known as Lord Kelvin after he was named Baron Kelvin of Largs.

  The unit $\textit{Henry}$ is the SI unit of electric inductance. 
  A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. 
  Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. 
  A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. 
  If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: 
  if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. 
  The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H). 
  The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents. 

  A $\textit{Henry}$ is defined as:

  $$\text{H} \; \equiv \; \text{henry}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{weber}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \frac{\text{V}\cdot\text{s}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{volt} \cdot \text{second}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \Omega\cdot\text{s}\; \equiv\; \text{ohm.second}$$

The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) $0\,decibel$ is equal to $1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared$. This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing. For sound pressure (the pressure exerted by the sound waves) 0 decibels equals $20\,micropascals\,RMS$, and for sound power $0\,decibels$ sometimes equals $1\,picoWatt$.

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

The most important property of a conductor is the amount of current it will carry when a voltage is applied. 
Current flow is opposed by resistance in all circuits, and by also by reactance and impedance in alternating current circuits. 
Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance, and impedance, respectively. 
To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm. In other words, the conductance, susceptance, or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms.

  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,
   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).
  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:

  $$\text{pH}=-\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\equiv-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)$$

  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of
   the hydrogen ion in the solution.
  $$$$
  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\ mol/l$, 
   where $aH+ \equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\ mol/L\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.
  $$$$
  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\circ$), typically taken as $1 \ mol/kg$, 
   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.
  $$$$
  The activity can be expressed as:

  $$a_{H^+} = \gamma_{H^+} \times m_{H^+}$$ 

  Where, $\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for
   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.
  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, 
   expressed in $mol/kg$.
  $$$$
  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:

  $$\text{pH} = -log_{10}\left(m_{H+}\times\gamma_{H^+}\right)$$

  $$$$
  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. 
  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.
  $$$$
  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,
  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high
  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.
  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,
   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).
  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:

  $$\text{pH}=-\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\equiv-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)$$

  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of
   the hydrogen ion in the solution.
  $$$$
  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\ mol/l$, 
   where $aH+ \equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\ mol/L\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.
  $$$$
  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\circ$), typically taken as $1 \ mol/kg$, 
   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.
  $$$$
  The activity can be expressed as:

  $$a_{H^+} = \gamma_{H^+} \times m_{H^+}$$ 

  Where, $\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for
   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.
  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, 
   expressed in $mol/kg$.
  $$$$
  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:

  $$\text{pH} = -log_{10}\left(m_{H+}\times\gamma_{H^+}\right)$$

  $$$$
  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. 
  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.
  $$$$
  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,
  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high
  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.
  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.

  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).

  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

Informally, if one sound is $1\,bel$ (10 decibels) ""louder"" than another, this means the louder sound is 10 times louder than the fainter one. A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly the aspect of sound being measured. For sound intensity (the power of the sound waves per unit of area) $0\,decibel$ is equal to $1\,picoWatts\,per\,Metre\,Squared$. This corresponds approximately to the faintest sound that can be detected by a person who has good hearing. For sound pressure (the pressure exerted by the sound waves) 0 decibels equals $20\,micropascals\,RMS$, and for sound power $0\,decibels$ sometimes equals $1\,picoWatt$. In all cases, one decibel equals $\approx\,0.115129\,neper$.",2

Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>",NA,0

  Electric potential is defined as the amount of potential energy present per unit of charge. 
  Electric potential is measured in volts, with one volt representing a potential of one joule per coulomb of charge. 
  The name of the unit honors the Italian scientist Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), the inventor of the first battery.
  The volt also may be expressed with a variety of other units. 
  For example, a volt is also equal to one watt per ampere ($W/A$) and one joule per ampere per second ($J/A/s$).

The intensity of a magnetic field can be measured by placing a current-carrying conductor in the field. The magnetic field exerts a force on the conductor, a force which depends on the amount of the current and on the length of the conductor. One tesla is defined as the field intensity generating one newton of force per ampere of current per meter of conductor. Equivalently, one tesla represents a magnetic flux density of one weber per square meter of area. A field of one tesla is quite strong: the strongest fields available in laboratories are about 20 teslas, and the Earth's magnetic flux density, at its surface, is about 50 microteslas. The tesla, defined in 1958, honors the Serbian-American electrical engineer Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), whose work in electromagnetic induction led to the first practical generators and motors using alternating current. $T =  V\cdot s \cdot m^{-2} = N\cdot A^{-1}\cdot m^{-1} = Wb\cdot m^{-2} = kg \cdot  C^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}\cdot A^{-1} = kg \cdot s^{-2}\cdot A^{-1} = N \cdot s \cdot C^{-1}\cdot m^{-1}$ where, $\\$ $A$ = ampere, $C$=coulomb, $m$ = meter,  $N$ = newton, $s$ = second, $T$ = tesla, $Wb$ = weber",0

The most important property of a conductor is the amount of current it will carry when a voltage is applied. 
Current flow is opposed by resistance in all circuits, and by also by reactance and impedance in alternating current circuits. 
Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance, and impedance, respectively. 
To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm. In other words, the conductance, susceptance, or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms. 
The unit is named for the German electrical engineer Werner von Siemens (1816-1892).
$$\  \text{Siemens}\equiv\frac{\text{A}}{\text{V}}\equiv\frac{\text{amp}}{\text{volt}}\equiv\frac{\text{F}}{\text {s}}\equiv\frac{\text{farad}}{\text{second}}$$

  In physics, the Planck time, denoted by $t_P$, is the unit of time in the system of natural units known as Planck units. 
  It is the time required for light to travel, in a vacuum, a distance of 1 Planck length. 
  The unit is named after Max Planck, who was the first to propose it.
  
  The formula for $\textit{PlankTime}$ is:
  
  $$ \\ t_P \equiv  \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.39106(32) \times 10^{-44} s$$
  
   where, $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant
    (defined as $\hbar = \frac{h}{2 \pi}$ and $G$ is the gravitational constant. 
  The two digits between parentheses denote the standard error of the estimated value.

  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,

  The $\textit{relative permittivity}$ of a material under given conditions reflects the extent to which it concentrates electrostatic lines of flux. 
  In technical terms, it is the ratio of the amount of electrical energy stored in a material by an applied voltage, 
  relative to that stored in a vacuum. 
  Likewise, it is also the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared to a similar capacitor that has a vacuum as its dielectric. 
  Relative permittivity is a dimensionless number that is in general complex. 
  The imaginary portion of the permittivity corresponds to a phase shift of the polarization $P$ relative to $E$ and leads to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves passing through the medium.
  $$\epsilon_r(w) = \frac{\epsilon(w)}{\epsilon_O}$$,
   where $\epsilon_r(w)$ is the complex frequency-dependent absolute permittivity of the material,
    and $\epsilon_O$ is the vacuum permittivity.

The $\textit{normal cubic metre}$ is a unit for liquid products conforming to the Dutch Mining Regulations (Mijnbouwregeling) for reporting in the Dutch oil and gas industry, and used predominantly for crude oil. As such, it is a measure of the actual amount of oil, not the volume of the oil. The reference conditions for a Dutch normal cubic metre are 0 degrees Celsius at 1 standard atmosphere (atm), equivalent to 101.325 kilopascals (kPa) of pressure.

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object.

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance.

  The $\textit{Mohm}$ is a unit of mechanical mobility for sound waves, being the reciprocal of the mechanical $ohm$ unit of impedance, i.e., for an acoustic medium, the ratio of the flux or volumic speed (area times particle speed) of the resulting waves through it to the effective sound pressure (i.e. force) causing them, the unit being qualified, according to the units used, as m.k.s. or c.g.s. 
  The mechanical ohm is defined as:
  $$Mohm \equiv 1\,dyn\cdot\,s\cdot cm^{-1} \text{ or } 10^{-3} N\cdot s\cdot m^{-1}$$.

  The unit $\textit{Square Metres per Second}$ is the SI derived unit of angular momentum, defined by distance
   or displacement in metres multiplied by distance again in metres and divided by time in seconds. 
  The unit is written in symbols as $m^2/s$ or $m^22s^{-1}$. 
  It may be better understood when phrased as $\textit{metres per second times metres}$, i.e. the momentum
   of an object with respect to a position.

  The unit $\textit{}$, symbol $kg/mol$, is the base SI unit for molar mass.
  In chemistry, the molar mass $M$ is defined as the mass of a given substance (chemical element or chemical compound) divided by its amount of substance. 
  It is a physical property of a given substance.  
  However, for historical reasons, molar masses are almost always expressed in $g/mol$. 
  As an example, the molar mass of water is approximately: $18.01528(33) \; g/mol$.

  The unit $\textit{Kelvin}$ is the SI base unit of temperature, previously called the degree Kelvin. 
  One kelvin represents the same temperature difference as one degree Celsius. 
  In 1967 the General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the temperature of the triple point of water
   (the temperature at which water exists simultaneously in the gaseous, liquid, and solid states) to be exactly 273.16 kelvins. 
  Since this temperature is also equal to 0.01 u00b0C, the temperature in kelvins is always equal to 273.15 plus the temperature in degrees Celsius. 
  The kelvin equals exactly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  The unit is named for the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson (1824-1907),
   later known as Lord Kelvin after he was named Baron Kelvin of Largs.

In the equation for torque on a moment, the torque is measured in joules and the magnetic field in tesla, so the moment is measured in Joules per Tesla (J u00b7T-1). These two representations are equivalent: 1 A u00b7m2 = 1 J u00b7T-1.",NA,0

A mean sidereal day is about 23 h 56 m 4.1 s in length. However, due to variations in the rotation rate of the Earth, the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock. In practice, the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC-UT1, which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory. A Sidereal Hour is $1/24^{th}$ of a Sidereal Day. A mean sidereal day is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0916 seconds (23.9344699 hours or 0.99726958 mean solar days), the time it takes Earth to make one rotation relative to the vernal equinox. (Due to nutation, an actual sidereal day is not quite so constant.) The vernal equinox itself precesses slowly westward relative to the fixed stars, completing one revolution in about 26,000 years, so the misnamed sidereal day (""sidereal"" is derived from the Latin sidus meaning ""star"") is 0.0084 seconds shorter than Earth's period of rotation relative to the fixed stars.",0

  The unit $\textit{Henry}$ is the SI unit of electric inductance. 
  A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. 
  Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. 
  A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. 
  If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: 
  if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. 
  The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H). 
  The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents. 

  A $\textit{Henry}$ is defined as:

  $$\text{H} \; \equiv \; \text{henry}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{weber}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \frac{\text{V}\cdot\text{s}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{volt} \cdot \text{second}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \Omega\cdot\text{s}\; \equiv\; \text{ohm.second}$$

  The Gauss is identical to maxwells per square centimetre; technically defined in a three-dimensional system, 
  it corresponds in the SI, with its extra base unit the ampere. 
  The gauss is quite small by earthly standards, 1 Gs being only about four times Earth's flux density,

The gram was originally defined to be the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water, but to provide precise standards it was necessary to construct physical objects of specified mass. One gram is now defined to be 1/1000 of the mass of the standard kilogram, a platinum-iridium bar carefully guarded by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris for more than a century.

The better the insulator, the larger the charge that the conductors can hold. This property of a circuit is called capacitance, and it is measured in farads. One farad is defined as the ability to store one coulomb of charge per volt of potential difference between the two conductors. This is a natural definition, but the unit it defines is very large. In practical circuits, capacitance is often measured in microfarads, nanofarads, or sometimes even in picofarads (10-12 farad, or trillionths of a farad).

  The unit $\textit{Dioptre}$, or $\textit{Diopter}$, is a unit of measurement for the optical power of a lens or curved mirror,
   which is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres (that is, $1/metre$). 
  For example, a $3 \; dioptre$ lens brings parallel rays of light to focus at $1/3\,metre$. 
  The same unit is also sometimes used for other reciprocals of distance, particularly radii of curvature
   and the vergence of optical beams. 
  Though the diopter is based on the SI-metric system it has not been included in the standard so that there is
   no international name or abbreviation for this unit of measurement within the international system of units
    this unit for optical power would need to be specified explicitly as the inverse metre.

  The unit $\textit{Celsius}$, also known as centigrade, is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature. 
  It can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, 
  a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. 
  This definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part 
  in 273.16 (approximately 0.00366) of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. 
  Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. 
  Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely $273.15^{\circ}\text{C}$.

The factor-of-ten is what is important, not the unit used, so $3.14 rad/s$ is one decade down from $31.4 rad/s$.",0

  It can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, 
  a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. 
  This definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part 
  in 273.16 (approximately 0.00366) of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. 
  Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. 
  Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely $273.15^{\circ}\text{C}$.

Most consumer desktop liquid crystal displays have luminances of 200 to 300 $cd/m^2$; the sRGB spec for monitors targets 80 cd/m2. HDTVs range from 450 to about 1000 cd/m2. Typically, calibrated monitors should have a brightness of $120 cd/m^2$. $Nit$ is believed to come from the Latin word nitere, to shine.",0

  The $\textit{Becquerel}$ is the SI derived unit of activity, usually meaning radioactivity.
  Radioactivity is caused when atoms disintegrate, ejecting energetic particles. 
  One becquerel is the radiation caused by one disintegration per second; 
  this is equivalent to about $27.0270 \text{picocuries (pCi)}$. 
  The unit is named for a French physicist, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908), 
  the discoverer of radioactivity. 
  Note: both the becquerel and the hertz are basically defined as one event per second, 
  yet they measure different things. 
  The hertz is used to measure the rates of events that happen periodically in a fixed and definite cycle. 
  The becquerel is used to measure the rates of events that happen sporadically and unpredictably, 
  not in a definite cycle.

Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>",NA,0

"[pH]","PH","Acidity","http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/PH","http://qudt.org/vocab/dimensionvector/A0E0L0I0M0H0T0D1",0,NA,"
  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,
   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).
  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:

  $$\text{pH}=-\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\equiv-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)$$

  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of
   the hydrogen ion in the solution.
  $$$$
  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\ mol/l$, 
   where $aH+ \equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\ mol/L\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.
  $$$$
  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\circ$), typically taken as $1 \ mol/kg$, 
   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.
  $$$$
  The activity can be expressed as:

  $$a_{H^+} = \gamma_{H^+} \times m_{H^+}$$ 

  Where, $\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for
   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.
  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, 
   expressed in $mol/kg$.
  $$$$
  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:

  $$\text{pH} = -log_{10}\left(m_{H+}\times\gamma_{H^+}\right)$$

  $$$$
  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. 
  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.
  $$$$
  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,
  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high
  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.
  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.

  The $\textit{relative permittivity}$ of a material under given conditions reflects the extent to which it concentrates electrostatic lines of flux. 
  In technical terms, it is the ratio of the amount of electrical energy stored in a material by an applied voltage, 
  relative to that stored in a vacuum. 
  Likewise, it is also the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared to a similar capacitor that has a vacuum as its dielectric. 
  Relative permittivity is a dimensionless number that is in general complex. 
  The imaginary portion of the permittivity corresponds to a phase shift of the polarization $P$ relative to $E$ and leads to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves passing through the medium.
  $$\epsilon_r(w) = \frac{\epsilon(w)}{\epsilon_O}$$,
   where $\epsilon_r(w)$ is the complex frequency-dependent absolute permittivity of the material,
    and $\epsilon_O$ is the vacuum permittivity.

The term denier is from the French denier, a coin of small value (worth 1/12 of a sou). Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to 1/24 of an ounce. The term microdenier is used to describe filaments that weigh less than one gram per 9,000 meter length.",NA,0

For irrigation water, the volume of $1 ft \times 1 \; ac = 43,560 \; ft^{3} (1,233.482 \; m^{3}, 325,851 \; US gal)$.",0

  The unit $\textit{Celsius}$, also known as centigrade, is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature. 
  It can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, 
  a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. 
  This definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part 
  in 273.16 (approximately 0.00366) of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. 
  Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. 
  Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely $273.15^{\circ}\text{C}$.
